## There are two types of question.

## $W b$ - questions

We answer a $W b$ - question with a piece of information.
We usually say $W b$ - questions with falling intonation. ( $\downarrow$ )

## Page 24

Yes/No questions
Yes/No questions start with the verb to be or an auxiliary verb.
Examples: Are you happy?
Do you want a cup of tea?
Can you tell me the time, please?
They produce the answer Yes or No.
We usually say Yes/No questions with rising intonation. ( $\uparrow$ )
Practise asking both types of question. Your voice rises or falls on on word in the question. You will see $(\downarrow)$ or $(\uparrow)$ before the words where this happens. Say each question.

1 Who's your best $(\downarrow)$ friend?
2 Where does your best friend $(\downarrow)$ live?
3 What does your best friend like $(\downarrow)$ doing?
4 Does your best friend like $(\uparrow)$ sailing?
5 Does your best friend live $(\uparrow)$ nearby?
6 Does your best friend have a $(\uparrow)$ boat?

A His occupation
B His favourite hobby
C Frequency of visits to restaurants

3 How old is he? $\square$ $(\uparrow)(\downarrow)$
4 What does he do? $\square$ $(\uparrow)(\downarrow)$

1 Every stage of a scientific experiment should ...

2 This report will ...
$\square$
3 If the procedure isn't written up, it is impossible to...

4 Scientific experiments set out to...

5 Experiments should always...
a) answer a question.
b) be measurable and show cause and effect.
c) be recorded and written up.
d) monitor progress and exchange information.
e) show your results and conclusions.

## Page 105

B Read the information about writing up experiments. Then discuss this report. What is wrong with it?

| QUESTION | Why do some heavy things <br> float? | This is not detailed enough. You <br> should say, for example. Why do metal <br> ships float on water? |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| RESEARCH | Some things float on water. |  |
| HYPOTHESIS | Perhaps water is solid. |  |
| MATERIALS | water, things |  |
| PROCEDURE | Put some things in water. <br> See what happens. |  |
| DATA | I put some things in water. <br> The small heavy things sank <br> but some of the flat heavy <br> things floated. |  |
| SUMMARY | Flat things usually float. |  |
| CONCLUSION | My idea was wrong. |  |

## Page 106

C Do heavy things fall faster than light things? Devise an experiment to find out. Write it up on the form below.

INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE - PB72
A Read the text and answer the questions.
1 How many times does the piston go up and down in one cycle? $\qquad$
2 The cycle shown in the table is for a four-stroke engine. What are the names of the four strokes?

## Page 107

3 One of these strokes is also called the power stroke. Can you work out which one? Explain your answer.

4 Where do these elements of the engine come from?
a) the spark $\qquad$
b) the petrol and air mixture $\qquad$
5 Where do these elements go to?
a) the burnt mixture $\qquad$
b) the power $\qquad$
6 Why is petrol and air sucked into the cylinder when the piston moves down?
$\qquad$
$\qquad$

7 Why is the burnt mixture pushed out of the exhaust valve when the piston moves up?
$\qquad$
$\qquad$

C Write questions for each of these answers.
1 How can we see the Moon? Because of light from the Sun.

## Page 109

$\qquad$
$\qquad$
$\qquad$

Because the position of the Moon changes in relation to the Earth.

Because the Moon spins on its own axis.

Because the Moon sometimes passes between the Earth and the Sun.
